Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) provides a means of directly
computing the noncovalent interaction between two molecules, that is, the
interaction energy is determined without computing the total energy of the
monomers or dimer. In addition, SAPT provides a decomposition of the
interaction energy into physically meaningful components: *i.e.*,
electrostatic, exchange, induction, and dispersion terms. In SAPT, the 
Hamiltonian of the dimer is partitioned into contributions from each 
monomer and the interaction.

.. math:: H=F_A+W_A+F_B+W_B+V

Here, the Hamiltonian is written as a sum of the usual monomer Fock
operators, :math:`F`, the fluctuation potential of each monomer, :math:`W`, and the
interaction potential, :math:`V`. The monomer Fock operators, :math:`F_A+F_B`, are
treated as the zeroth-order Hamiltonian and the interaction energy is
evaluated through a perturbative expansion of :math:`V`, :math:`W_A`, and :math:`W_B`. 
Through first-order in :math:`V`, electrostatic and exchange interactions are
included; induction and dispersion first appear at second-order in :math:`V`. For
a complete description of SAPT, the reader is referred to the excellent
review by Jeziorski, Moszynski, and Szalewicz .
