Introduction 
==================================================================

In SAPT (Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory), second-order dispersion 
:math:`E_{disp}^{(20)}` and exchange dispersion :math:`E_{exch-disp}^{(20)}` energies 
describe inter-molecular correlation effects, constituting a reliable tool 
in examination of the nature of interaction energies [Jeziorski:1994:1887]_. 
Importantly, dispersion energy using the SAPT approach provides the possibility 
of studying these contributions independently from others and can be added on top
of any energy decomposition methods. However, :math:`E_{disp}^{(20)}` and :math:`E_{exch-disp}^{(20)}`
suffer from a serious problem, namely they are notably slowly convergent with respect to 
the basis set size. It has been shown that the explicitly correlated F12 methods greatly 
speed up the convergence of electron correlation energy. Therefore, they were adapted for 
dispersion energy resulting with :math:`E_{disp}^{(20)}`-F12 and :math:`E_{exch-disp}^{(20)}`-F12. 
For a complete description of these methods, the reader is referred to :cite:`2018:Kodrycka`
